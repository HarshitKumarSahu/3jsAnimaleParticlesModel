# Animale

Animale is a playful, interactive web project that showcases a carousel of whimsical animal-themed personas, each with their own unique style and personality. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, Three.js and Shaders, the project features a visually engaging interface and smooth transitions between different animal "stripes."

## Features

- **Interactive Carousel:** Switch between different animal personas (Horse, Bear, Deer, Canine, Giraffe) using intuitive buttons.
- **Creative Visuals:** Each animal stripe features a unique design, title, and playful tagline.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and hot module replacement.
- **GLSL Support:** Uses `vite-plugin-glsl` for potential WebGL/GLSL shader integration.
